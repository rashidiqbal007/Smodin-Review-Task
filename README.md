# Smodin-Review-Task
 
TASK: 
Above the essay, create a feedback section that asks users for a 1-5 star rating on the essay, then a 1-5 star rating about the site, and finally, if the user submitted 5 stars for both, ask the user to leave us a review on a 3rd party (like TrustPilot). Make sure to track (with an example/mock function) when the user clicks the “leave us a review” button.
